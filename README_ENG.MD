Overall, I'm pleased with the solutions and pleasantly surprised by how accessible they are. Some of the problems involved basic data structures, while others introduced new concepts. I don't consider this a drawback of the algorithm section; in fact, I'm delighted to have the opportunity to learn something new.

What also amazes me is that I couldn't find any solutions for the last two parts in Go. I feel a bit guilty about posting incomplete solutions. Let me share what I couldn't achieve:  
Task 1 - It crashes on the third test, typically a result of an edge case.  
Task 29 - It crashes on the eighth test, and I'm not sure what the error is.  
Task 30 - It crashes on the twelfth test, and I can't identify the error. I even used a data structure, but it consumes a lot of memory.  
Task 34 - There's a representation error, and I'm not sure where it's coming from.  
Task 35 - It crashes on the ninth test, likely an issue with the chosen solution method.  
Task 39 - It fails on the first test, which is quite amusing. The code is correct, but for some reason, my answer of "6" doesn't match their answer of "6"  

I would greatly appreciate any recommendations and advice on my current solutions! You can reach me via email at 1pyankov.d.s@gmail.com.
